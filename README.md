This repository will keep track of the foods and calories consumed from March 31st to April 6th

My name is Jeanne Obenland.  I am a returning part-time MC scholar.  I am working full-time but am fortunate to have telework capability so I can be home several days a week.  I am working towards a General Education degree that will transfer to a 4-year school, although I do not know what I would like to major in.  This class is part of the Gen Ed Core requirements, but I also wanted to learn more about the modern world of data and computers that is all around me.  The more I learn, the more amazed I am at the amazing creative minds that have brought us to where we are in the digital era.
